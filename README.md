# PREDICTIVE SAFETY MODELLING FOR IDENTIFYING ROAD ACCIDENT HOTSPOTS USING MACHINE LEARNING

The main objective of this project is to harness the power of machine learning to
develop a predictive safety model capable of identifying road accident hotspots with
a high degree of accuracy. By integrating historical accident data with various contextual features such as road infrastructure, traffic flow and weather conditions the
model aims to uncover hidden patterns and relationships that can aid in predicting
areas prone to accidents.
The projectâ€™s scope revolves around developing a machine learning model for predicting road accident hotspots. The primary objective is to create a robust and efficient system capable of accurately identifying the road accident hotspots, thereby
enhancing potential risks. To achieve this, the project will leverage various tools and
libraries, including Python, Scikit-learn, among others. Python will serve as the primary programming language due to its versatility and extensive support for machine
learning tasks. Scikit-learn will be utilized for implementing traditional machine
learning algorithms. The methodologies utilized in this project encompass the Random Forest algorithm. Which involve several key steps, including data collection, preprocessing,
feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and deployment. Datasets containing
historical accident data along with relevant contextual features such as road infrastructure details, traffic patterns and weather conditions be collected and preprocessed
to ensure data quality and consistency. Feature extraction techniques will be applied
to extract relevant information from the raw data, which will then be used to train and
evaluate machine learning models using the Random forest algorithm. Model performance will be assessed using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall,
and F1 score, thereby contributing to the overarching goal of reducing the incidence
of road accidents and promoting safer transportation systems.
