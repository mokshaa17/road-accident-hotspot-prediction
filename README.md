PREDICTIVE SAFETY MODELLING FOR IDENTIFYING ROAD ACCIDENT HOTSPOTS USING MACHINE LEARNING

The main objective of this project is to harness the power of machine learning to
develop a predictive safety model capable of identifying road accident hotspots with
a high degree of accuracy. By integrating historical accident data with various contextual features such as road infrastructure, traffic flow and weather conditions the
model aims to uncover hidden patterns and relationships that can aid in predicting
areas prone to accidents.
